  - The finest components for second-generation atomic vehicles are only available
    from me.
  - I've heard you can buy a few things from this list at your place.
  - I don't understand, I only have parts for vehicles.
  - I'm not from the government; I need these parts for... uh, a confidential project.
  - My friend, I don't want to get involved in these matters. It's better you go
    your own way.
  - I promise you won't encounter me again.
  - Fine, I need to get rid of this hassle anyway.
